# Changelog - Version 7.0

> **Status: in development.** This document tracks changes landing on the `7.0` branch.
> Nothing here is released yet, and the contents may still change.

## Breaking Changes

- None.

## New Features

- `FakeSenderWrapper` keeps every envelope it is given. `FakeSenderWrapper::getSent()`
  returns them, oldest first, and `FakeSenderWrapper::clear()` forgets them, so a test can
  check what the application would have sent. Sending still does nothing and always
  succeeds.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6 are now supported: `"php": ">=8.3 <8.7"`.
  The previous `<8.6` upper bound excluded PHP 8.6, since `<8.6` is exclusive.

### ByJG dependencies

- `byjg/convert` is now `^7.0`.
- `byjg/webrequest` is now `^7.0`.

While 7.0 is unreleased these resolve to `7.0.x-dev` from each component's
`7.0` branch, via `minimum-stability: dev` with `prefer-stable: true`.

## Toolchain

- PHPUnit updated to `^12.5`.
- Psalm is installed as `psalm/phar` instead of `vimeo/psalm`.

  `vimeo/psalm` lists the PHP versions it supports and no published release includes
  8.6, so as a dev dependency it made `composer install` fail on the 8.6 build job
  before any test ran. `psalm/phar` requires only `php ^8.2` and bundles its own
  dependencies, so it installs on every PHP version in the matrix and cannot conflict
  with the project's. Psalm itself still refuses to *run* on 8.6, which is why the
  Psalm job uses 8.5. `composer psalm` runs it.

- PHPUnit 13 is deliberately **not** used. It requires PHP `>=8.4.1`, breaking the
  8.3 floor.

## Continuous Integration

- The build matrix now includes PHP 8.6.
- The Psalm job runs on PHP 8.5.

## Housekeeping

- `phpunit.xml.dist` renamed to `phpunit.xml`.
- The wrapper tests now run. They were named `*TestWrapper.php`, which PHPUnit's default
  `Test.php` suffix skips, so the Amazon SES, FakeSender, Mailgun and PHPMailer tests had
  not been running. They are renamed to `*WrapperTest.php`. The Amazon SES test, broken
  unnoticed since `getSesClient()` gained its `SesClient` return type, now uses the SDK's
  `Aws\MockHandler` instead of the `MockSender` stand-in, which is removed.
- `phpunit.xml` sets `ignoreIndirectDeprecations="true"`. PHP 8.6 deprecates `is` as a class
  name, and `guzzlehttp/promises` (required by the AWS SDK) has a class called `Is`.
  Deprecations raised inside this package's own `src/` still fail the suite.
